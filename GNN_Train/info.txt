This folder contains the code needed to process molecular cage information using GNN and to train the GNN.

mol_cage_graph_neighbour.py & mol_cage_graph.py: Encode molecular SMILES of cage precursors to tensors of atom information and connectivity 
information (adjacence matrix). Encoding with neighbour information was used by default. The code was used by database/db_preparation.py to generate input to GNN.

cage_gnn.py: GNN built using pytorch to process precursor vectors of building blocks and linkers of cages.

gnn_train.py: Code to train and test the GNN model.
